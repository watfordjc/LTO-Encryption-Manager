# LTO-Encryption-Manager
**LTO-Encryption-Manager** will provide LTO tape AES key management using SLIP-0021 symmetric key derivation from a BIP-0039 wallet seed phrase.

LTO-Encryption-Manager is part of the [**Data Backups and Archiving GitHub Project**](https://github.com/users/watfordjc/projects/2).

This repository is a work in progress.

It will eventually implement the key derivation scheme discussed in [backup-policy/wiki/LTO-Encryption-Keys](https://github.com/watfordjc/backup-policy/wiki/LTO-Encryption-Keys).
