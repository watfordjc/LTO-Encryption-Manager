# LTO-Encryption-Manager
LTO tape AES key management using SLIP-0021 symmetric key derivation from a BIP-0039 wallet mnemonic.

This repository is a work in progress.

It will eventually implement the key derivation scheme discussed in [backup-policy/wiki/LTO-Encryption-Keys](https://github.com/watfordjc/backup-policy/wiki/LTO-Encryption-Keys).
